# 10 Python Projects to Showcase Your Skills

These projects are designed to test your understanding of Python basics. Complete them one at a time, submit your code, and I’ll provide feedback. Each project includes a brief description and requirements.

## Project 1: Simple Calculator
**Description**: Create a command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.

**Requirements**:
- Use functions to define each operation.
- Use conditionals to select the operation based on user input.
- Handle division by zero errors.
- Allow continuous calculations until the user chooses to exit.

## Project 2: To-Do List Manager
**Description**: Build a to-do list application where users can add, view, update, and delete tasks.

**Requirements**:
- Use a list to store tasks.
- Create functions for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks.
- Use loops to display a menu and handle user choices.
- Save tasks to a file using the `json` module.

## Project 3: Number Guessing Game
**Description**: Develop a game where the computer generates a random number, and the user tries to guess it.

**Requirements**:
- Use the `random` module to generate a number between 1 and 100.
- Use loops and conditionals to provide hints (e.g., "too high" or "too low").
- Track the number of attempts and display it when the user guesses correctly.
- Allow the user to play multiple rounds.

## Project 4: Contact Book
**Description**: Create a contact book to store names, phone numbers, and emails.

**Requirements**:
- Use a dictionary to store contacts.
- Define a `Contact` class with attributes for name, phone, and email.
- Implement functions to add, search, and delete contacts.
- Use loops for a menu-driven interface.

## Project 5: Password Generator
**Description**: Build a program that generates random passwords based on user-specified criteria.

**Requirements**:
- Use the `random` and `string` modules.
- Allow users to specify password length and whether to include letters, digits, and special characters.
- Use functions to generate and validate passwords.
- Ensure at least one character from each selected category is included.

## Project 6: Text Analyzer
**Description**: Create a program that analyzes a text file and provides statistics (e.g., word count, sentence count, most common words).

**Requirements**:
- Use file I/O to read a text file.
- Use string methods and loops to count words and sentences.
- Use a dictionary to track word frequencies.
- Display the top 3 most common words.

## Project 7: Simple Bank System
**Description**: Simulate a banking system where users can create accounts, deposit, withdraw, and check balances.

**Requirements**:
- Define an `Account` class with attributes for account number, holder name, and balance.
- Use functions for deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking.
- Use conditionals to validate transactions (e.g., sufficient funds).
- Store accounts in a list or dictionary.

## Project 8: Hangman Game
**Description**: Implement the classic Hangman game where users guess letters to complete a word.

**Requirements**:
- Use the `random` module to select a word from a predefined list.
- Use loops to handle guesses and track remaining attempts.
- Use conditionals to check if guesses are correct.
- Display the current state of the word (e.g., `_ _ l l _`).

## Project 9: Expense Tracker
**Description**: Build an application to track income and expenses, categorizing them and calculating a budget.

**Requirements**:
- Use a class to represent transactions (amount, category, date).
- Use lists or dictionaries to store transactions.
- Implement functions to add transactions and calculate total income, expenses, and balance.
- Save data to a file using the `csv` module.

## Project 10: Tic-Tac-Toe
**Description**: Create a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game with a command-line interface.

**Requirements**:
- Use a list to represent the 3x3 game board.
- Define functions for displaying the board, handling player moves, and checking for a win or draw.
- Use loops and conditionals to alternate turns and validate moves.
- Allow players to play multiple games.

## Submission Instructions
- Complete each project in the order listed.
- Submit your code for each project as a single Python file (e.g., `project1_calculator.py`).
- Share the code by pasting it in your response or uploading it (if supported).
- I’ll assess each submission for correctness, structure, readability, and efficiency, providing detailed feedback.

## Next Steps
After completing and assessing all 10 projects, I’ll:
1. Summarize your strengths and areas for improvement.
2. Provide tailored steps to enhance your Python skills.
3. Introduce Flask, FastAPI, and Django with practical examples to build web applications.
